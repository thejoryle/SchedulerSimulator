A mid-complexity case with dispirate burst times and
some overlapping arrival times. SRTN was expected to have the
best turnaround and wait times, with FIFO expected to be the worst.
FIFO and RR(q=2) performed very similarly in this scenario as well.

FIFO:
Job   0 -- Turnaround   8.00 Wait   0.00
Job   1 -- Turnaround  19.00 Wait   7.00
Job   2 -- Turnaround  20.00 Wait  17.00
Job   3 -- Turnaround  25.00 Wait  19.00
Job   4 -- Turnaround  28.00 Wait  25.00
Average -- Turnaround  20.00 Wait  13.60

SRTN:
Job   0 -- Turnaround  14.00 Wait   6.00
Job   1 -- Turnaround  31.00 Wait  19.00
Job   2 -- Turnaround   3.00 Wait   0.00
Job   3 -- Turnaround  16.00 Wait  10.00
Job   4 -- Turnaround   5.00 Wait   2.00
Average -- Turnaround  13.80 Wait   7.40

RR(q = 2):
Job   0 -- Turnaround  26.00 Wait  18.00
Job   1 -- Turnaround  31.00 Wait  19.00
Job   2 -- Turnaround  12.00 Wait   9.00
Job   3 -- Turnaround  20.00 Wait  14.00
Job   4 -- Turnaround  14.00 Wait  11.00
Average -- Turnaround  20.60 Wait  14.20

A higher complexity test case with multiple instances 
of duplicate arrival times and edge cases where shortest
remaining time conflicts at certain points. Edge case handling
unspecified at the time, SRTN ran with lowest value job number 
priority at conflicts (ie. Job 0 runs before Job 2 if same remaining
time and neither were the previous running process).

FIFO:
Job   0 -- Turnaround   5.00 Wait   0.00
Job   1 -- Turnaround  13.00 Wait   5.00
Job   2 -- Turnaround  14.00 Wait  11.00
Job   3 -- Turnaround  15.00 Wait  14.00
Job   4 -- Turnaround  18.00 Wait  14.00
Job   5 -- Turnaround  22.00 Wait  17.00
Job   6 -- Turnaround  25.00 Wait  22.00
Average -- Turnaround  16.00 Wait  11.86

Job   0 -- Turnaround   6.00 Wait   1.00
Job   1 -- Turnaround  29.00 Wait  21.00
